For efficient data organization, analysis, and sharing, it is essential for collaborators to provide comprehensive and standardized metadata for the different file types. Here are some suggested metadata fields for the various file types:

    Sample Metadata

    Sample ID: Unique identifier for the sample
    Sample type: DNA or RNA
    Tumor cell line: Name or identifier of the tumor cell line
    Collection date: Date of sample collection
    Institution: Name of the institution that prepared and sequenced the sample
    Contact person: Name and contact information of the person responsible for the sample

    Sequencing Technology Metadata

    Sequencing platform: Name of the sequencing platform used (e.g., Illumina, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore)
    Sequencing technology: Type of sequencing technology employed (e.g., short-read, long-read, linked-read)
    Sequencing kit: Name and version of the sequencing kit used
    Sequencing library preparation: Library preparation method and kit used
    Read length: Read length of the sequencing run

    Raw Data Metadata (FASTQ files)

    File name: Name of the FASTQ file
    Read type: Paired-end or single-end
    Read direction: Forward or reverse (for paired-end data)
    File format: FASTQ file format version
    File size: Size of the FASTQ file

    Alignment Metadata (BAM files)

    File name: Name of the BAM file
    Reference genome: Name and version of the reference genome used for alignment
    Alignment tool: Name and version of the alignment software used
    Alignment parameters: Parameters used in the alignment process
    File format: BAM file format version
    File size: Size of the BAM file

    Variant Call Metadata (VCF files)

    File name: Name of the VCF file
    Variant caller: Name and version of the variant calling software used
    Variant calling parameters: Parameters used in the variant calling process
    Genomic regions: Targeted or whole-genome sequencing
    File format: VCF file format version
    File size: Size of the VCF file

    Genome Assembly Metadata (FASTA files)

    File name: Name of the FASTA file
    Assembly method: Name and version of the genome assembly software used
    Assembly parameters: Parameters used in the genome assembly process
    Assembly type: De novo, reference-guided, or hybrid
