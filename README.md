Proposed data management workflow for GIAB tumor sample.
This is a work in progress. Most of the files were initially generated by chatGPT with promots from ND Olson. 
Feel free to explore this repository and provide feedback but know that most of the scripts are raw chatGPT and will require significant revisions for use.

# Project Data Management Workflow

This README provides an overview of the data management workflow for the project
characterizing genomic variants in reference material DNA and RNA. The workflow
describes how data will be organized, shared, evaluated, and preserved throughout
the project.

## Proposed Data Organization

The data may be organized in the following directory structure on the FTP server:

```
project_root/

├── metadata/
│   ├── sample_metadata.tsv
│   └── sequencing_technology_metadata.tsv

```

File Naming Convention:

    Raw data: sample_[sample_number]_[read_pair].fastq.gz
    Example: sample_1_1.fastq.gz

    Variant call files: sample_[sample_number].vcf.gz and sample_[sample_number].vcf.gz.tbi
    Example: sample_1.vcf.gz

    Genome assembly files: sample_[sample_number].fasta.gz
    Example: sample_1.fasta.gz

    Analysis and evaluation files: descriptive file names with appropriate file extensions, such as .tsv, .txt, or .csv
    Example: comparison_results.tsv

    Alignment files: sample_[sample_number].bam and sample_[sample_number].bam.bai
    Example: sample_1.bam

The naming convention uses a combination of sample identifiers, sequencing technology or analysis type, and file format extensions to clearly and consistently label files.

## Data Sharing

The following types of data will be shared via the FTP server:

1. Raw Data: Raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) generated from different sequencing
   technologies will be stored in separate directories labeled with relevant metadata.

2. Variant Call Sets and Genome Assemblies: Collaboratively generated variant call
   sets (VCF files) and genome assemblies (FASTA files) will be uploaded to the FTP
   server. Each file will include appropriate metadata and versioning information.

## Quality Control

1. Internal Evaluation: The project team will internally evaluate the reference
   characterizations. This will involve assessing the quality of variant call sets
   and genome assemblies, comparing results across sequencing technologies, and
   verifying consistency with expected findings.

2. External Evaluation: External collaborators will generate orthogonal variant call
   sets for comparison with the reference characterizations. Discrepancies will be
   manually curated using a genome viewer (e.g., IGV) to ensure accuracy.

## Long-Term Preservation

1. Data Backup: Regular backups of the FTP server will be performed to ensure data
   integrity and availability. Multiple copies of the data will be stored on separate
   storage systems.

2. Version Control: The FTP server will employ version control mechanisms to track
   changes in the data, ensuring traceability and reproducibility.

3. Persistent Identifiers: Data files, including variant call sets and genome
   assemblies, will be assigned persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs or DataCite) for
   long-term discoverability and accessibility.

## Data Access and Collaboration

1. Collaboration Agreement: Collaborators accessing the data on the FTP server will
   be required to sign a collaboration agreement or data access agreement outlining
   the terms of data usage, including proper citation, data handling, and publication
   policies.

2. Access Control: The FTP server will implement access controls to restrict data
   access to authorized collaborators based on project roles and responsibilities.

3. Collaboration Platform: A dedicated collaboration platform will be used to facilitate
   effective communication, data sharing, and coordination among project members and
   collaborators.

## Ethical Considerations and Data Privacy

1. Ethical Compliance: The project will adhere to relevant ethical guidelines,
   regulations, and institutional policies regarding the handling, storage, and sharing
   of genomic data.

2. Anonymization: Personal identifiers will be removed or de-identified from the data
   to protect patient privacy and comply with data protection regulations.

3. Informed Consent: If applicable, appropriate informed consent will be obtained from
   the individuals involved in providing the reference material DNA and RNA.

TODO 
- Add schema check for metadata json
- get feedback on metadata schema
- separate metadata template for data analysis providers
- Create dev environment for this workflow
- Break project up into multiple repositories: nextflow pipelines, cdn stack, metadata management, and test data generation.
- Impliment ci/cd framework
