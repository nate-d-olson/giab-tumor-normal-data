## Code Requirements

As a contributor to our project, we value code quality, maintainability, and consistency. To ensure a high standard of code, please adhere to the following requirements when submitting code changes:

1. **Coding Style**: Follow the established coding style and conventions used in the project. This includes indentation, naming conventions, and code organization. Make sure your code is easy to read and understand.

2. **Documentation**: Provide clear and concise documentation for your code changes. This includes inline comments, docstrings, and any additional documentation required to explain the purpose and usage of your code.

3. **Testing**: Include appropriate tests to cover the functionality and edge cases of your code changes. Make sure the tests are thorough, reliable, and maintainable. Run the existing test suite to ensure your changes do not break existing functionality.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and validation in your code. Handle potential exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages and logging when necessary.

5. **Security**: Be mindful of security best practices and avoid introducing any security vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the code. Ensure that sensitive data is handled securely and that any inputs are properly validated and sanitized.

## Code Review Process

To maintain code quality and ensure consistency across the project, all code changes must go through a code review process. Here is an overview of the code review process:

1. **Pull Request**: Create a pull request (PR) on the designated repository, following the naming conventions and guidelines outlined in the project's contribution guidelines.

2. **Reviewers**: The project maintainers will assign one or more reviewers to your PR. Reviewers will provide feedback, suggestions, and comments on your code changes.

3. **Address Feedback**: Review and address the feedback received from the reviewers. Make necessary changes and improvements to your code based on the feedback.

4. **Approval and Merging**: Once the reviewers are satisfied with the code changes, they will approve the PR. The project maintainers will then review the changes and merge the PR if everything is in order.

Please note that code reviews are a collaborative process aimed at improving code quality and fostering knowledge sharing. It is important to maintain a respectful and constructive approach during the code review process.

By following these code requirements and participating in the code review process, we can ensure that the project maintains a high standard of code quality and consistency.
