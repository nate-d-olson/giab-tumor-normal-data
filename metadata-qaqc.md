Summary statistics and quality control metrics are essential for assessing the quality and reliability of the generated data. Here is a list of suggested summary statistics and quality control metrics for the different data types in your project:

    Raw Sequencing Data (FASTQ files)

    Total number of reads
    Average read length
    Read length distribution
    Base quality distribution
    GC content distribution
    Adapter content
    Overrepresented sequences
    Ambiguous base call (N) content
    Duplicate read rate

    Alignment Data (BAM files)

    Total number of aligned reads
    Alignment rate (percentage of aligned reads)
    Mean mapping quality
    Distribution of mapping quality scores
    Coverage depth and uniformity
    Percentage of bases covered at different depths (e.g., 1x, 10x, 20x, etc.)
    Insert size distribution (for paired-end data)
    Chimeric read pairs rate (for paired-end data)
    Duplicate read rate
    Mismatch rate and distribution
    Indel rate and distribution
    Strand balance

    Variant Calls (VCF files)

    Total number of called variants (SNVs, InDels, and others)
    Transition/Transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio
    Variant allele frequency distribution
    Variant quality distribution
    Genotype quality distribution
    Depth distribution of called variants
    Homozygous/heterozygous variant ratio
    Functional annotation of variants (e.g., synonymous, non-synonymous, splice site, etc.)
    Number of variants in coding regions, introns, intergenic regions, etc.
    Known/novel variant ratio (based on existing databases)

    Genome Assemblies (FASTA files)

    Total number of contigs/scaffolds
    Total assembled genome size
    N50, L50, and other assembly statistics
    Longest and shortest contig/scaffold
    Contig/scaffold length distribution
    GC content distribution
    Genome completeness assessment (e.g., BUSCO or other gene content-based metrics)
    Contamination check (e.g., presence of non-target organism sequences)

Generating these summary statistics and quality control metrics for the different data types will help you assess the quality of your data, identify potential issues, and ensure the reliability of downstream analyses. Various tools are available for generating these metrics, such as FastQC, Qualimap, Picard, GATK, and QUAST, among others.
