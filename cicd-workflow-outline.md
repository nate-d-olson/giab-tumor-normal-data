 CI/CD framework for this data management workflow might include the following components:

    Source code repository: A Git repository to store the code for the data management workflow, including the CDK stacks, Python scripts, web portal, and any other components.

    Code review: A code review process to ensure that changes to the source code are reviewed and approved by one or more team members before they are merged into the main branch.

    Continuous integration: A CI process to automatically build and test the source code whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This could include running unit tests, linting the code, and building the Docker images for the different pipelines.

    Artifact repository: A repository to store the artifacts generated by the CI process, such as the Docker images, Nextflow config files, and other artifacts.

    Continuous deployment: A CD process to automatically deploy the changes to a development or staging environment for testing. This could involve deploying the CDK stacks using the AWS CLI or CDK CLI, running the Nextflow pipelines on a cloud-based cluster, and deploying the web portal to a cloud-based hosting service.

    Automated testing: Automated tests to verify that the deployment was successful and that the data management workflow is working as expected. This could include testing the Nextflow pipelines using test data, testing the web portal using automated UI tests, and testing the Athena queries using automated SQL queries.

    Manual testing: Manual testing to verify that the data management workflow is working correctly and meets the requirements. This could involve manual testing of the Nextflow pipelines, manual testing of the web portal, and manual testing of the Athena queries.

    Production deployment: A production deployment process to deploy the data management workflow to a production environment after it has been tested and approved. This could involve deploying the CDK stacks, running the Nextflow pipelines, and deploying the web portal to a production hosting service.

By implementing a CI/CD framework for this data management workflow, you can ensure that changes to the source code are thoroughly tested and deployed in a controlled and repeatable manner, reducing the risk of errors and improving the reliability of the workflow.
