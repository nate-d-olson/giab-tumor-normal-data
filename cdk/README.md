# Steps for creating a development environment to deploy and test stacks.

1. Install the AWS CLI and configure it with credentials that have permission to create resources in your AWS account.

1. Install Node.js and npm on your local machine.

1. Install the AWS CDK CLI by running npm install -g aws-cdk in your terminal.

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.

1. Initialize a new CDK app by running cdk init app --language python. This will create a new Python CDK app in the current directory.

1. Update the requirements.txt file to include the required Python packages for your project, such as pandas, numpy, boto3, botocore, and any others you may need.

1. Install the Python dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.

1. Create a new Python file for each CDK stack you need to deploy, such as data_mgmt_stack.py, pipeline_stack.py, s3_stack.py, and web_portal_stack.py. Define the stack using the appropriate CDK constructs and resources for your project.

1. Update the app.py file to include your CDK stacks and any other configuration settings you need, such as S3 bucket names, Athena database names, and other stack parameters.

1. Define the S3 bucket names, Athena database names, and other stack parameters as environment variables in a .env file in the root directory of your project. Load the environment variables using the python-dotenv package in your Python code.

1. Define any Python scripts you need to generate test data, such as generate_fastq.py, generate_bam.py, generate_vcf.py, and any others. Make sure these scripts use the environment variables defined in the .env file to specify S3 bucket names and other settings.

1. Define any Makefile targets you need to generate test data, upload data to S3, and deploy CDK stacks. Make sure these targets use the environment variables defined in the .env file to specify S3 bucket names and other settings.

1. Test your CDK stacks by running cdk deploy in your terminal. This will deploy your stacks to your AWS account and create any required resources.

1. Test your Python scripts by running them in your terminal. Make sure they generate the expected output and use the correct S3 bucket names and other settings.

1. Test your Makefile targets by running make commands in your terminal. Make sure they generate the expected test data and upload it to the correct S3 bucket.

1. Test your web portal by deploying it to an AWS EC2 instance or other hosting service, and make sure it can access the Athena database and display the expected data.

1. Iterate on your CDK stacks, Python scripts, and Makefile targets as needed until they meet your requirements.

By following these steps, you can create a development environment for deploying and testing your CDK stacks, Python scripts, and web portal, and ensure that they are working correctly before deploying to production.
