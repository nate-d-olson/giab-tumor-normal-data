Data Management Plan (DMP)

    Introduction
    The project aims to characterize genomic variants in a batch of reference material DNA and RNA from a tumor cell line using different sequencing technologies at various institutions. The data generated will be made publicly available on an FTP server, allowing collaborators to access the data, generate variant call sets, and perform genome assemblies. These results will then be used for reference characterizations and further downstream analysis.

    Data Collection
    2.1. Sample Preparation
    The tumor cell line DNA and RNA samples will be prepared following standardized protocols to ensure consistency and quality across different institutions.

2.2. Sequencing Technologies
Various sequencing technologies, including short-read, long-read, and linked-read sequencing, will be used to maximize the coverage and accuracy of the genomic variant characterization.

2.3. Data Formats
Raw sequencing data will be stored in standard formats (e.g., FASTQ, BAM, VCF) to facilitate sharing and collaboration among researchers.

    Data Storage and Management
    3.1. Data Storage
    The raw and processed data will be stored in a secure and centralized FTP server, providing easy access for collaborators to download and analyze the data.

3.2. Metadata
Standardized metadata, such as sample information, sequencing technology, and processing pipeline details, will be included to facilitate data interpretation and reproducibility.

3.3. Data Backup
Regular backups of the FTP server will be performed to ensure data integrity and prevent data loss.

    Data Sharing and Access
    4.1. Public Access
    The data will be made publicly available on the FTP server to promote collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility in research.

4.2. Access Control
Collaborators will be provided with secure login credentials to access the FTP server, ensuring that only authorized users can download and modify the data.

4.3. Data Usage License
The data will be released under an open-access license, allowing researchers to freely use, modify, and share the data for non-commercial purposes.

    Data Analysis and Evaluation
    5.1. Internal Evaluation
    The reference characterizations will be initially evaluated internally by comparing the variant call sets and genome assemblies generated by different institutions.

5.2. External Evaluation
Orthogonal variant call sets will be compared to the reference characterizations to assess the accuracy and reliability of the results. Manual curation of discrepancies will be performed using a genome viewer, such as IGV.

    Data Archiving and Preservation
    6.1. Long-term Storage
    Following the completion of the project, the data will be archived in a long-term storage facility, such as a public data repository or an institutional data archive.

6.2. Data Retention
The data will be retained for a minimum of 10 years, in accordance with data preservation guidelines and institutional policies.

    Ethical Considerations and Compliance
    7.1. Ethical Approval
    The project will be conducted in accordance with relevant ethical guidelines and will obtain appropriate ethical approval as required.

7.2. Data Privacy
Any sensitive or personally identifiable information will be removed or anonymized to protect participant privacy and comply with data protection regulations.
