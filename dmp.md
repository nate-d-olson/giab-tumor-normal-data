# Project DMP: Characterizing Genomic Variants in Reference Material DNA and RNA

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to characterize genomic variants in a batch of reference material DNA and RNA obtained from a tumor cell line. The project involves multiple institutions utilizing different sequencing technologies. The generated data will be made publicly available via an FTP server, where collaborators can access it to generate variant call sets and genome assemblies. These variant call sets and genome assemblies will be used for downstream analysis and reference characterizations.

## Data Sharing
1. Raw Data: The raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) generated from different sequencing technologies will be stored and shared via the FTP server. Each dataset will be organized in separate directories, labeled with relevant metadata (e.g., institution, sequencing technology).
2. Variant Call Sets and Genome Assemblies: The collaboratively generated variant call sets and genome assemblies will be uploaded to the FTP server as VCF files and FASTA files, respectively. These files will also include appropriate metadata and versioning information.

## Data Organization
1. Directory Structure: The FTP server will follow a structured directory hierarchy to organize the data. The directory structure will include top-level directories for each institution involved, and within each institution directory, subdirectories will be created to store the specific data files and associated metadata.
2. Metadata: Metadata for each data file will be provided in standardized formats, such as JSON or YAML. The metadata will include details such as sample ID, sequencing technology, platform version, and experimental parameters used.

## Quality Control
1. Internal Evaluation: The reference characterizations will undergo internal evaluation by the project team. This evaluation will include assessing the quality of the generated variant call sets and genome assemblies, comparing results across different sequencing technologies, and verifying consistency with expected findings.
2. External Evaluation: To ensure the quality of the reference characterizations, orthogonal variant call sets will be generated by external collaborators. These orthogonal datasets will be compared to the reference characterizations for validation. Any discrepancies will be manually curated using a genome viewer, such as IGV (Integrated Genomics Viewer).

## Long-Term Preservation
1. Data Backup: Regular backups of the FTP server will be performed to ensure data integrity and availability. Multiple copies of the data will be maintained on separate storage systems.
2. Version Control: The FTP server will employ version control mechanisms to track changes in the data, ensuring traceability and reproducibility.
3. Persistent Identifiers: Data files, including variant call sets and genome assemblies, will be assigned persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs or DataCite) to ensure long-term discoverability and accessibility.

## Data Access and Collaboration
1. Collaboration Agreement: Collaborators accessing the data on the FTP server will be required to sign a collaboration agreement or data access agreement outlining the terms of data usage, including proper citation, data handling, and publication policies.
2. Access Control: The FTP server will implement access controls to restrict data access to authorized collaborators. Access permissions will be granted based on project roles and responsibilities.
3. Collaboration Platform: A dedicated collaboration platform (e.g., project management software, communication tools) will be established to facilitate effective communication, data sharing, and coordination among project members and collaborators.

## Ethical Considerations and Data Privacy
1. Ethical Compliance: The project will comply with all relevant ethical guidelines, regulations, and institutional policies regarding the handling, storage, and sharing of genomic data.
2. Anonymization: Personal identifiers will be removed or de-identified from the data to protect patient privacy and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
3. Informed Consent: If applicable, appropriate informed consent will be obtained from the individuals
