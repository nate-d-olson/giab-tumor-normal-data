This document describes the output files generated by the summary statistics and quality control pipelines for the different data types.
Raw Sequencing Data (FASTQ files)
FastQC reports

The FastQC pipeline generates a quality control report (in HTML format) for each input FASTQ file. The reports contain various summary statistics and quality control metrics, including base quality distribution, read length distribution, GC content distribution, and more. These reports can be viewed in a web browser.

The reports are stored in the fastqc_reports directory under the output directory.
Alignment Data (BAM files)
SAMtools stats reports

The SAMtools pipeline generates a summary statistics report (in plain text format) for each input BAM file. The reports contain various summary statistics and quality control metrics, including alignment rate, mean mapping quality, coverage depth and uniformity, and more.

The reports are stored in the samtools_stats directory under the output directory.
Variant Call Sets (VCF files)
BCFtools stats reports

The BCFtools pipeline generates a summary statistics report (in plain text format) for each input VCF file. The reports contain various summary statistics and quality control metrics, including total number of called variants, transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio, variant allele frequency distribution, and more.

The reports are stored in the bcftools_stats directory under the output directory.
Genome Assemblies (FASTA files)
QUAST reports

The QUAST pipeline generates a quality assessment report (in plain text format) for each input genome assembly file in FASTA format. The reports contain various summary statistics and quality control metrics, including total number of contigs/scaffolds, assembly size, N50, and more.

The reports are stored in the quast_reports directory under the output directory.
Conclusion

These pipelines generate summary statistics and quality control metrics for the different data types in your project, and store the results in a structured way. These output files can be used to assess the quality and reliability of your data, identify potential issues, and ensure the reliability of downstream analyses.
